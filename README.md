# house-machinelearning
This is a study project!
In this project I used machine learning to try to find the right price to sell the house. The conclusion was that the algorithm has an accuracy of 82% is not perfect, but I don't know if I will improve

Use is simple, play the script in order on jupyter or colab and don't forget to put dataset in the right place
